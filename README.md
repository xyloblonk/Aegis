## üì¶ Installation

Clone the repository and launch the installer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xyloblonk/aegis.git
cd aegis
sudo ./aegis.sh
````

The guided setup will configure:

* Provider credentials
* Backup sources
* Encryption options
* Scheduling & retention

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Configuration is stored in structured directories:

* **`/etc/backup-automator/`**

  * Provider credentials
  * Retention policy
  * Encryption keys
* **`/usr/local/bin/backup-scripts/`**

  * Generated scripts (`run_backup.sh`, `upload_backup.sh`, etc.)
* **`/var/log/backup-automator/`**

  * Logs of backup jobs, pruning, and cron runs
* **`/backups/`**

  * Temporary staging of backup archives before upload

You can re-run the setup at any time to adjust configuration.

## üîê Security

* All backups can be encrypted at rest with **AES-256-CBC**.
* Encryption keys are stored under `/etc/backup-automator/encryption/key.bin` with restrictive permissions.
* Aegis enforces:

  * **Least privilege file ownership**
  * **Secure defaults for cloud provider authentication**
  * **Logging for audit compliance**

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** If you lose the encryption key, your backups cannot be recovered. Store it securely in a password manager or hardware vault.

## üóì Scheduling & Retention

Backups are run via cron jobs:

* **Backup execution:** `/etc/cron.d/backup-automator`
* **Pruning & cleanup:** Daily at 01:00 AM

Example retention policy (`/etc/backup-automator/retention.conf`):

```ini
RETAIN_HOURLY=24
RETAIN_DAILY=7
RETAIN_WEEKLY=4
RETAIN_MONTHLY=12
```

This ensures recent backups are preserved while controlling storage growth.

## üöÄ Usage

Trigger a manual backup job:

```bash
sudo /usr/local/bin/backup-scripts/run_backup.sh default
```

View logs:

```bash
tail -f /var/log/backup-automator/backup.log
```

List backups available in staging:

```bash
ls /backups/
```

## üõ† Recovery

To restore from a backup:

1. Retrieve the archive from your configured cloud provider.
2. Decrypt (if encrypted):

   ```bash
   openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in backup.tar.gz.enc -out backup.tar.gz -pass file:/etc/backup-automator/encryption/key.bin
   ```
3. Extract:

   ```bash
   tar -xzf backup.tar.gz -C /restore/path
   ```
4. Import databases or mount configs as needed.

(A guided restore utility is on the roadmap.)

## üìä Roadmap

* [ ] Incremental & differential backups
* [ ] Borg/Restic backend integration
* [ ] Restore automation script
* [ ] Parallelized uploads for large archives
* [ ] Alerting and monitoring hooks (Prometheus, Grafana)
* [ ] Web UI for management and reporting

## üèó Architecture Overview

Aegis is composed of:

* **Setup wizard (`aegis.sh`)**
  Collects provider credentials, sets up configs, schedules jobs.

* **Backup execution scripts**
  Handle staging, encryption, compression, and provider uploads.

* **Retention engine**
  Applies retention policies across local staging and cloud provider storage.

* **Logging system**
  Generates structured logs for every stage of the process.
